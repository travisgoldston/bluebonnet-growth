            <h2>Why Google Maps Rankings Matter in McKinney</h2>
            <p>When someone in McKinney searches "plumber near me," "HVAC McKinney TX," or "coffee near the Square," the first thing they see is usually a map with three businesses highlighted. That section is powered by Google Business Profiles. If you're not in that local pack, you miss a big share of the calls and visits, even if your website is solid.</p>
            <p>Ranking in Google Maps isn't about tricks. It's about making it easy for Google to see who you are, where you serve, and why you’re a good option for searchers nearby. For most local businesses in <a href="../seo-company-mckinney-tx.html">McKinney</a>, that comes down to a complete, accurate profile and a website that backs it up.</p>

            <h2>What Google Looks At for Maps Rankings</h2>
            <p>Google uses several signals to decide who shows up in the map pack. Your <strong>Google Business Profile</strong> is the main one: the right categories, a clear description, accurate hours and service area, and recent activity (photos, posts, Q&amp;A) all matter. <strong>Reviews</strong>—how many you have and how you respond—matter too. So does <strong>consistency</strong>: your business name, address, and phone should match on your profile, your website, and anywhere else you're listed online.</p>
            <p>For McKinney businesses, <strong>relevance</strong> to the search is key. If someone searches "HVAC near Craig Ranch," Google wants to show businesses that actually serve that area and have made that clear in their profile and on their site. The more specific and accurate your information, the better Google can match you to the right searches.</p>

            <h2>Practical Steps to Improve Your Maps Visibility</h2>
            <p>Start by claiming or verifying your Google Business Profile and fixing any wrong information. Choose the most accurate primary category (and secondary categories if they fit). Add a short description that mentions your services and your service area—McKinney, or specific neighborhoods like Historic Downtown, Craig Ranch, or Eldorado—without stuffing keywords. Keep your hours, phone number, and website URL correct.</p>
            <p>Add photos regularly: your team, your work, your location or service area. Answer questions in the Q&amp;A section and post occasional updates or offers. On your website, make sure your contact and service pages clearly state where you serve and link to the same information Google has. The goal is to give Google and your customers one consistent story.</p>

            <h2>When to Get Help</h2>
