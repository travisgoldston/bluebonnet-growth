            <h2>Start with the Basics, Not the Buzzwords</h2>
            <p>Most small business owners in North Texas don't have time for jargon. You just want to show up when someone in your city searches for what you do. The good news is that the basics still matter most: a complete Google Business Profile, a website that clearly explains your services and service area, and consistent information everywhere your business appears.</p>
            <p>If you're in or around <a href="../seo-company-mckinney-tx.html">McKinney</a>, <a href="../seo-company-melissa-tx.html">Melissa</a>, or <a href="../seo-company-anna-tx.html">Anna</a>, you’re competing with both local operators and bigger brands. Getting the fundamentals right puts you in the conversation when neighbors search, without needing a national-agency budget.</p>

            <h2>Tip 1: Claim and Complete Your Google Business Profile</h2>
            <p>Your Google Business Profile is the listing that shows up when people search for your business name or for a service plus your city. If you haven't claimed it, do that first. Then fill in everything: correct name, address, phone, hours, website, and a short description that says what you do and where you serve. Add a few good photos. Choose the right primary category—this tells Google what kind of business you are. The more complete and accurate your profile, the more likely Google is to show you in the local map and list.</p>

            <h2>Tip 2: Make Your Website Clear and Local</h2>
            <p>Your website doesn't need to be fancy, but it does need to be clear. Have a contact page with your phone number and email. On your service pages, mention the cities or areas you serve—McKinney, Melissa, Frisco, or "North Texas"—in plain language. Page titles and headings that include your city and service help Google (and visitors) understand what each page is about. Keep your business name, address, and phone the same on your site as on your Google profile and anywhere else you're listed.</p>

            <h2>Tip 3: Stay Consistent Everywhere You're Listed</h2>
            <p>Google and customers trust businesses whose information matches across the web. If your address is different on your website than on Yelp or the Chamber site, that can hurt. Use the same spelling for your business name, the same address format, and the same phone number everywhere. Fix old or wrong listings when you find them. Consistency builds trust and helps Google show you for the right local searches.</p>

            <h2>Tip 4: Ask for Reviews and Respond to Them</h2>
            <p>Reviews matter for local SEO and for convincing people to choose you. After a good job or sale, ask happy customers to leave a review on your Google Business Profile. When someone leaves a review—positive or not—respond in a professional, helpful way. That shows you're engaged and gives you a chance to correct misunderstandings or thank people. Steady, genuine reviews over time help more than a sudden burst of questionable ones.</p>

            <h2>Putting It Together</h2>
            <p>You don't have to do everything in one week. Start with your Google Business Profile and your website basics. Then work on consistency and reviews.
