          <p class="hero-subtitle">Your Google Business Profile is often the first thing people see when they search for your type of business in McKinney. It’s not optional anymore.</p>

            <h2>What a Google Business Profile Actually Is</h2>
            <p>Your Google Business Profile is the listing that shows your name, reviews, hours, phone number, and directions when someone searches for your business name or for a service + “near me.” It powers the local map results and the local pack that appear above many organic results. For local businesses in <a href="../seo-company-mckinney-tx.html">McKinney</a>, it’s often where people decide who to call before they ever click through to a website.</p>
            <p>You don’t need a big marketing budget to benefit from it. You do need the basics to be right: correct information, the right categories, an honest description, good photos, and a website that backs up what your profile says.</p>

            <h2>Why McKinney Businesses Can't Skip It</h2>
            <p>When someone in McKinney searches for a plumber, a dentist, or a coffee shop, Google often shows a map and a short list of three businesses right at the top. Those spots come from Google Business Profiles. If you don't have a profile, or yours is incomplete or wrong, you're missing that prime real estate. Your competitors are there. Customers are making decisions from that list—calling, clicking, or driving to the next result. For local businesses, your profile isn't optional anymore; it's your front door on Google.</p>

            <h2>What to Get Right on Your Profile</h2>
            <p><strong>Claim or verify</strong> your listing so you control the information. Use your <strong>real business name</strong> (no extra keywords). Pick the <strong>primary category</strong> that best describes what you do—this strongly influences when Google shows you. Add a <strong>short description</strong> that says what you offer and where you serve, in plain language. Set your <strong>hours</strong>, <strong>phone</strong>, and <strong>website</strong> correctly. If you serve customers at their location (like many contractors and service pros in McKinney), set your <strong>service area</strong> so Google knows which cities or regions you cover.</p>
            <p>Add <strong>photos</strong>—your team, your work, your location if you have one. Use the <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> section to answer common questions. Post occasional <strong>updates</strong> or offers so your profile looks active. And make sure the name, address, and phone on your profile <strong>match exactly</strong> what's on your website and anywhere else you're listed. Inconsistencies confuse Google and can hurt your visibility.</p>

            <h2>How It Fits Into Local SEO</h2>
            <p>Your Google Business Profile is one part of local SEO. Your website, your citations (listings on other sites), and your reviews all work together. But for many McKinney businesses, the profile is the highest-impact piece: it's what shows up in the map and the local pack. Getting it right first, then keeping your website and other listings consistent, is the smart order of operations.</p>
