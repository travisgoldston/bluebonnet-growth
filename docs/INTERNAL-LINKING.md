# Internal Linking & Local Entity Signals

Use this structure to help Google classify Bluebonnet Growth as a local service-area business (McKinney + Collin County / North Texas corridor).

## From blog content
- **Every blog post:** Link to homepage (“Back to Bluebonnet Growth home”), relevant city page (e.g. Melissa post → `seo-company-melissa-tx.html`), and `services.html` or `contact.html`.
- **New posts:** Add 1–2 contextual links to city pages (e.g. “local SEO in Anna” → `seo-company-anna-tx.html`) and to `resources/north-texas-small-business-online-growth.html` or `mckinney-tx-seo-for-home-services.html` when relevant.

## From city pages
- **Every city page:** “Bluebonnet Growth home” (or “Back to Bluebonnet Growth home”) in the body + logo link to `index.html`. Link to 1–2 sibling city pages and `services.html`.
- **Anchor text:** Use “Bluebonnet Growth,” “our home page,” “McKinney local SEO,” “local SEO for [City],” “our services,” “contact” so the entity and service area stay clear.

## From homepage
- **Index:** Link to `seo-company-mckinney-tx.html`, `services.html`, `pricing.html`, `about.html`, `blog.html`, `contact.html`, and each city page from the Other Cities section.
- **“How we do it” / “Our process”:** Link to `services.html` (and optionally `contact.html`).

## From services & pricing
- **Services:** Link to city pages (e.g. “McKinney” → `seo-company-mckinney-tx.html`), `pricing.html`, `contact.html`, and service subpages (plumber, electrician, HVAC, etc.).
- **Pricing:** Link to `services.html` and `contact.html`; in copy, mention “McKinney” or “Collin County” with a link to `seo-company-mckinney-tx.html` or the resource page when natural.

## From about & contact
- **About:** Link to `services.html`, `contact.html`, and “McKinney” → `seo-company-mckinney-tx.html` or homepage.
- **Contact:** Link to `services.html` and `pricing.html` so the path from contact to service/pricing is clear.

## Local entity signals (already in place)
- Footer on every page: “Bluebonnet Growth is a McKinney, Texas–based local SEO company. We are not affiliated with other Bluebonnet-named businesses in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.”
- H1s include city name or “Collin County” + “SEO” or “local marketing.”
- City pages and blog use “Bluebonnet Growth” by full name at least twice.
- Sitemap includes all city pages, blog, and key service URLs so crawl and classification stay consistent.
